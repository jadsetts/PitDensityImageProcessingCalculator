# PitDensityImageProcessingCalculator
This repository is for calculating pit density from an image. This converts images to r,g,b or r+g+b co-ordinates, then binarizes the image based on a user-input threshold level, then can invert the binarized image color, and finally detects the number of pits. A second function finds the size of the image. Finally the pit density is calculated.
